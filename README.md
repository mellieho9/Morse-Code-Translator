# Morse-Code-Translator
A website application that translates English to morse code and vice versa.

## Background
Translating words to morse code is simple, yet can serve many functions such as encrypting messages to even helping people with medical conditions communicate. The latter was why I decided to attend MLH's LHD:Share tutorial on morse code translation and thus created this project.

## Tech stack
- html
- javascript
- vscode

## Future implementations
1. Transitioning this application to a mobile application
2. Adding a functionality where the user can use the voice sensor to transfer taps into words (This can be particularly useful when the user is in danger and cannot dial anyone for help)
3. Improving the application's UI
